## Primary Persona
When you create an application, it's important to whom you are serving and for sure they are not programmers!

### Alex
Alex is 30 years old builder living in London. He is married and has a little children. He is always pressed for time, but try to have good plans for weekends. He is a bit introvert, therefore he surfs the net to find the new event around for weekends. He is not a professional mobile user, but he can call and send messages and use some simple mobile apps.


## Implementation

## Assumptions
- We have only one type of network API call in our network, so I injected the autherisation code to all requests in backend's network layers
